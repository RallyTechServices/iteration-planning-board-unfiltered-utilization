#Iteration Planning Board (Unfiltered Utilization)

The iteration planning board with Unfiltered Utilization shows the unfiltered utilization for each column, even when filters are applied.  

This is different from the Iteration Planning board in the App Catalog becuase the iteration planning board in the App Catalog shows filtered utilization.
