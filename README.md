#Iteration Planning Board (Unfiltered Utilization)

The iteration planning board with Unfiltered Utilization shows the unfiltered utilization for each column, even when filters are applied.  

This is different from the Iteration Planning board in the App Catalog becuase the iteration planning board in the App Catalog shows filtered utilization.  

Also, if the current project and iteration does not have a planned velocity set, then a link to "Set Planned Velocity" will be not be displayed (as in the out of the box planning app).
